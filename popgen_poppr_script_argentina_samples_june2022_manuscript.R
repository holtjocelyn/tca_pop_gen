#call the genetic distance estimates

#HOW IS THIS INTERPRETED? THE SCALE has what appears to be 10 clusters, which is difficult to visualize on the NJ Tree because the labels are close together.



#Population differentiation measured by FST was originally proposed by Sewall Wright (Wright, 1949). This was later extended to a method based on diversity by Masatoshi Nei (Nei, 1973). 
#As researchers applied these metrics to microsatellites, genetic markers with a large number of alleles, it became clear that Neiâ€™s measure would not correctly range from zero to one, so Philip Hedrick proposed a correction (Hedrick, 2005). 
#More recently, Lou Jost proposed another alternative (Jost, 2008). 
#You can tell a topic is popular when so many variants of it are generated. And there are more variants than mentioned here. 
#Discussion as to which measure may be appropriate for your data was posted to the Molecular Ecologist blog titled should I use FST, GST or D?.
